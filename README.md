# Password Management System

A simple, console-based password manager made using Python. This mini-project uses object-oriented programming, and file handling in Python. It securely stores, retrieves, updates, and deletes passwords for various websites using a master key for authentication.

---

## Features

- **Master Key Authentication**
- **Stores Passwords in JSON File**
- **Add New Passwords**
- **Update Existing Passwords**
- **Search Passwords by Website**
- **Remove Stored Passwords**
- **View All Stored Passwords**

## Master Key Security

- The master key is hardcoded and kept private using Python's double underscore convention (__masterkey).
- It can be made more robust with the encryption-decryption technique, using 'Fernet' module.

---

## Data Handling

- Passwords are stored in a password.json file located in the C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ directory.

- All website names are stored in lowercase to avoid case-sensitivity issues.

- Data is saved automatically on exit.

- If the file is missing or empty, a new one is created automatically.
